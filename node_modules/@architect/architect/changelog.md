## [5.9.23] 2019-07-23

### Fixed

- Fixed issue preventing Ruby functions from properly executing in `sandbox`
- Fixed issue prevent Python functions from properly executing in Windows `sandbox`
- Fix broken characters in Windows `sandbox` console
- Fixes super obscure bug where certain shared files may not be included in a single function deploy

### Changed

- `sandbox` context now passes an empty object (to be mocked soon!) to all runtimes
  - This deprecates the legacy AWS implementation of `context` (since retired in production) passed to `sandbox` Node functions

---

## [5.9.21-22] 2019-07-17

### Added

- Adds auto-hydration to new functions without restarting `sandbox`


### Fixed

- Fixes issue with auto-hydration on `sandbox` startup
- Fixes potential issue in static asset deploys in Windows

---

## [5.9.20] 2019-07-15

### Added

- Expanded support for static asset fingerprinting! If you've enabled fingerprinting (`@static fingerprint true`):
  - `sandbox` will regenerate your `public/static.json` file on startup
  - And whenever making any changes to your `public/` dir, `sandbox` auto-refresh will automatically regenerate `public/static.json` and re-hydrate your shared files with the latest version


### Fixed

- `sandbox` auto-refresh now detects file deletions from `src/shared` and `src/views`

---

## [5.9.19] 2019-07-12

### Added

- Adds PYTHONPATH to `sandbox` Lambda invocation for `/vendor` modules

### Fixed

- Fixes `sandbox` crashing when `get /` and other functions aren't defined in `.arc` or present in the filesystem, but are requested by a client
- Prevents startup of http server if `@http` isn't defined in `.arc`
- Improves `sandbox` support in Windows

---

## [5.9.18] 2019-07-12

### Fixed

- Fixes WebSocket provisioning issue

---

## [5.9.17] 2019-07-12

### Changed

- Disables delta resource creation during deployments
  - This functionality is better served by more reliable and deterministic resource creation via the forthcoming Architect 6 release

---

## [5.9.16] 2019-07-12

### Changed

- Reverts previous breaking change on WebSockets, default directories that get created are now once again `ws-connect`, `ws-default`, and `ws-disconnect`

---

## [5.9.15] 2019-06-26

### Added

- Auto-refresh! `sandbox` now keeps an eye out for the following changes to your project:
  - Edits to your Architect project manifest will mount or unmount HTTP routes without having to restart `sandbox`
  - Changes to `src/shared` and `src/views` will automatically rehydrate your functions' shared code
  - More to come!


### Changed

- Prettied up `sandbox` initialization printing a bit

---

## [5.9.14] 2019-06-25

### Added

- Auto-hydration!
  - Say goodbye to running `npx hydrate` before starting new projects, cloning existing projects, or pulling down new functions
  - On startup, any functions missing dependencies on the local filesystem will now be auto-hydrated
  - Supported runtimes and dependency manifests: Node + `package.json` (requires npm >= 5.7), Python + `requirements.txt` (calls pip3), and Ruby + Gemfile (calls bundle)

---

## [5.9.10-13] 2019-06-24

### Fixed

- Ensures `sandbox` starts in the cases of:
  - No local AWS credentials file (e.g `~/.aws/credentials`)
  - The local AWS credentials file is present, but is missing the requested profile name
  - Fixes #382, 391
- Fixed issue with `hydrate` caused by an errant merge

---

## [5.9.9] 2019-06-23

### Changed

- Projects that use WebSockets (`@ws`) in their `.arc` file will need to be cautious about upgrading
  - The default directories that get created are now `ws-$connect`, `ws-$default`, and `ws-$disconnect`; it is recommended that you run `npx create` and copy your code from `ws-connect` to `ws-$connect`, `ws-default` to `ws-$default`, and `ws-disconnect` to `ws-$disconnect` and then delete the old directories

### Fixes

- `@ws` directive now works correctly with the `npx inventory` command set
- Fixes `sandbox` wrapper when use as async module, adds `sandbox` test

---

## [5.9.8] - 2019-06-19

### Changed

- Deployments of static assets now follow symlinks in the `public/` directory

---

## [5.9.5-7] - 2019-06-18

### Changed

- The `sandbox` workflow is now its own module!
  - No functionality changes to `sandbox` in this release
  - A few minor improvements to `sandbox` console messages during startup, and drying up port assignment logic
  - You can find the `sandbox` module at https://github.com/architect/sandbox


### Fixed

- Some Arc-supported runtimes defined in `.arc-config` files (such as `nodejs8.10`) will no longer cause `sandbox` to crash

---

## [5.9.4] - 2019-06-15

### Added

- Added ability to disable Architect managing a given function's environment variables
  - Add an `@arc` pragma to your function's `.arc-config` file, and pass it the `env false` flag


---

## [5.9.3] - 2019-05-29

### Fixed

- Corrects URI encoding when accessing local static assets in _static, fixes #390

### Added

- CloudFormation support! ðŸš€
  - `npx package` will export the current `.arc` file to `sam.json` and print further instructions for deploying
  - Currently only `@http`, `@static` and `@tables` pragmas are supported; you can track the other pragmas dev (or submit a PR!) here at #386
  - Any env vars in `.arc-env` are automatically applied to the CloudFormation stack
  - `.arc-config` settings are also fully supported
  - Unfortunately CF currently has a bug with binary media types which we're tracking here https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/issues/561
- Static asset fingerprinting beta!
  - Add `fingerprinting true` to your `@static` pragma to enable fingerprinting
  - Add `ignore` followed by a two-space indented list to ignore certain files from `public/`
  - [More information here](https://arc.codes/reference/static)
- Added new flag for pruning old static assets: `npx deploy [--static] --prune`
- Added ability to completely disable shared folder copying into functions
  - Add an `@arc` pragma to your function's `.arc-config` file, and pass it the `shared false` flag
- Ruby and Python local runtime support
  - `.arc-config` with `runtime` of either `ruby2.5` or `python3.7` works on localhost (make sure you have python and ruby installed!)


### Fixed

- Hydration (and other things that depend on hydrator operations) should now work more reliably on non-UNIXy machines


---

## [5.8.7] - 2019-05-21

### Fixed

- Fixes lack of `console.[warn|error|trace]` output in sandbox console


## [5.8.5 - 5.8.6] - 2019-05-15

### Changed
- New GitHub name! Find us at: [github.com/architect](https://github.com/architect)
  - If you're already developing for Architect projects, don't forget to update your git remotes, e.g.: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/architect/architect.git && git remote -v`
  - Special thanks to @pug132 for the name (and a big hat-tip to @mikemaccana)!

---

## [5.7.0] - 2019-04-17

### Added

  - The list also includes: `nodejs8.10`, `python3.6`, `go1.x`, `dotnetcore2.1`, and `java8`
  - Specify `runtime $yourRuntime` in the `@aws` section of your project manifest, or `.arc-config` files
  - Of course, you can also add the runtime of your choosing by way of layer support
- Support for `application/binary-octet` & `multipart/form-data` requests, fixes #353
  - Requests with those two `Content-Type` headers will produce a `base64` object in the `body` object, like so: `body: {base64: 'R28gR2lhbnRzIQ=='}`
  - Empty request bodies will still produce an empty object (e.g. `body: {}`)


### Fixed

## [5.6.0 - 5.6.1] - 2019-04-04

### Added

- Enables both text and binary file transit in newly provisioned Arc apps
- Adds the same capability to `sandbox`
- This is NOT a breaking update, however if you'd like your existing app to serve binary assets, you'll need to re-create your API (or hang tight until we release our forthcoming API migration tool)
- Adds `req.httpMethod` and `req.queryStringParameters`
- Removes deprecated code paths

---


## [5.5.10] - 2019-03-15

### Added

- Cache-control header support to `sandbox`
  - Default for local dev environment is not to send any `cache-control` header
  - If specified, `cache-control` passes through


---

## [5.5.9] - 2019-03-13

### Added

- Cache-control header support; if not specified, defaults to:
  - HTML + JSON: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0, s-maxage=0`
  - Everything else: `max-age=86400`

- `test:watch` script and `tape-watch` devdep (due to multiple dependencies with CVEs)


---

## [5.5.0] - 2019-02-03

SPA support: mount S3 on the `/` of API Gateway

### Added

- `ANY /{proxy+}` will now route any 'not found' to the HTTP Lambda `src/http/get-index`
  - Note: proxy+ routes have a slightly different request payload that includes `request.requestContext` not available to regular HTTP Lambdas (so you can use this to test a 404 condition)
- `ANY /_static/{proxy+}` will proxy to S3 buckets defined by `@static` (if you want to skip proxying through Lambda)
- Companion library `@architect/functions` also gained `arc.proxy.public` superpower for proxying all requests NOT defined by `.arc` to the `@static` S3 buckets

[For more about single page apps with Architect see there docs here.](https://arc.codes/guides/spa)


### Changed

- If `@http` is defined, then `get /` must also be defined
- `npx sandbox` now mounts `/public` on `http://localhost:3333/_static` to match the deployed API Gateway S3 proxy


---

## [5.0.6] - 2019-01-25

### Added

- Improvements to build plugins system (did you know Architect has a build plugins system?)
  - Now supports NPM scoping (e.g. `@architect/arc-plugin-node-prune`)
  - Build preparation order now runs pre-deploy build plugins last (after dependency hydration)
  - Published a companion beta / demo plugin: [`@architect/arc-plugin-node-prune`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@architect/arc-plugin-node-prune), clean the cruft out of your `node_modules`!


### Fixed

- Fixes `create` breaking if `@ws` is not present in `.arc`, #276


---

## [5.0.4] - 2019-01-24

### Added

- `repl` now respects environments, allowing you to connect to your remote databases with the `NODE_ENV` environment variable


### Fixed

- `repl` was being clobbered by `@architect/data`'s own implementation; fixed in `architect/arc-data` #12, dependency updated


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


---

## [5.0.2] - 2019-01-22

### Added

- Support for `@ws` in `.arc` for generating WebSocket Lambdas and API Gateway endpoints
- Support for WebSocket Lambdas in the local sandbox
- WebSocket Lambdas support in `inventory`, which in turn powers most other workflows


### Removed

- Support for `@slack` as the more generic `@http` Lambdas support that use case better


### Fixed

- Fixes `@indexes` creation bug
- Runs `npm i` during `hydrate --update`, resolving a long-standing NPM issue where package-lock files may fall out of sync
- Fixed: on Windows, S3 assets will be correctly created relative to their location beneath `public` rather than their full paths.

### Changed

- Updated dependencies


---

## [4.5.6] - 2019-01-14

---

## [4.5.1] - 2019-01-08


### Changed

- `hydrate` refactor and API
  - NPM operations are now queued and concurrently processed (env var `ARC_MAX_NPM`, defaults to 10) /ht @grncdr
  - Vastly improved NPM error handling and related deployment reliability (fixes #141 + #151)
  - Now hydrates (and updates) deterministically from the current .arc manifest, as opposed to globbing
  - All NPM operations now use `npm ci` for more consistent behavior across environments
  - Updates `deploy` to use `hydrate` API, and `sandbox` to use new shared code copier module
- DynamoDB tables now use on-demand/pay-per-request billing mode, mitigating the need for capacity planning /ht @alexdilley
- `inventory` now supplies its own Arc project data, allowing it to be called as needed without relying on `util/init`


### Fixed

- Freshly created Functions are now properly hydrated with shared code (if available and appropriate; fixes #241)
- Running `create` on already existing projects now runs orders of magnitute faster
- `.arc` file is now reliably copied into each Function's `node_modules/@architect/shared` even if you don't use `src/shared` (needed by `@architect` deps)
- `deploy` now respects `--delete` flag when deploying the whole project
- Improved progress reporting in `CI` mode, and for `hydrate`, `create`, and `deploy`


### Added

- New command: `hydrate --shared [--update]` - hydrates and/or updates `src/shared` and `src/views` (if available)

---

## [4.4.12] - 2018-12-23


### Removed

The following folders are no longer required nor autogenerated:

- `src/shared`
- `src/views`
- `/public`

Functionality remains unchanged: Contents of `src/shared` are synced to `node_modules/@architect/shared` in all lambdas whenever deploying or using the sandbox. Contents of `src/views` are synced to all HTTP GET lambdas `node_modules/@architect/views`. Public is synced to S3 buckets.


---

## [4.4.11] - 2018-12-19


### Added

- Updates `sandbox`, adding minor performance tweaks now, and setting up for future enhancements
  - Updated `sandbox` to asynchronously read files when invoking a Lambdas
  - Updates runtime handling in `sandbox` to make it easier to add additional runtimes
  - Each runtime now lives in its own function, which also enables process forking later on


---

## [4.4.10] - 2018-12-18


### Added

- New logo (added to readme)! /ht @amberdawn
- `hydrate` and `deploy` now install dependencies in `src/shared` and `src/views` (#240)
- `QUIET` boolean env var suppresses init header (fixes #238)
  - Helpful for piping data to disk, e.g. setting up new users on an Architect project with `QUIET=1 npx env > .arc-env`
- `app.arc` app filename supported as a non-dotfile alternative to `.arc` (#239)


### Changed

- Static asset deploys now exclude default `public/readme.md` file
- Improved `hydrate` progress and completion confirmation
- Adds Architect version back into the init header


### Fixed

- `hydrate` was not properly globbing (and thus, not hydrating) `src/shared` contents


---

## [4.4.9] - 2018-12-16 (merge commit, no changes)


---

## [4.4.8] - 2018-12-12


### Added

- To help accommodate `sandbox` calling out to remote databases, `SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` env var allows you specify in seconds how long `sandbox` should wait for all child processes to complete
  - `SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` is overridden by any directory-specific `.arc-config` files


### Changed

- Default `sandbox` timeout is now symmetrical with Architect's default Lambda timeout time of 5 seconds

### Added

- Local `@queues` now available in `sandbox`
- Big ups to @grncdr for this feature!


### Fixed

- `hydrate` wasn't updated to use the new progress indicator, and would fail when used â€“ no longer!


---

## [4.4.4] - 2018-12-1


### Added

- `deploy` operations now read local and remote last-modified times, and will skip files whose times don't differ, thereby speeding up deploy operations of static files
- Big ups to @filmaj for this release, too!


---

## [4.4.3] - 2018-11-30


### Added

- `npx deploy static`: deploys only `@static` assets (as found in the `public/` folder)
  - Accepts `staging | --staging | -s` and `production | --production | -p` flags
- `npx deploy static --delete`: deploys static assets, and deletes remote S3 files not present locally in `public/`
  - Can be used with `staging` and `production` flags
- Big ups to @filmaj for this release!


---

## [4.4.0] - 2018-11-27


### Added

- Large refactor of `deploy` workflow to improve stability and reliability
- `deploy` now identifies missing project resources during deploy operations
  - Instead of failing / throwing errors, `deploy` now completes its first pass deployment
  - Then, once completed, `deploy` creates any resources missing from the deployment (and deploys them)


### Changed

- `npx inventory --nuke` now destroys `@static` resources (S3 buckets) and `@events` resources (SNS Topics).
- New projects will no longer create `arc-sessions` tables (for use with `@architect/functions`) by default, and are now explicitly opt-in
- Replaces `progress` module with a lighter weight, more readily cross-platform homegrown solution


---
